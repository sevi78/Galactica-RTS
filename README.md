![(Screenshot (5).png](Screenshot (5).png)

this is a hobby project, not professional. I love to code, even if it sometimes too complicated for my brain capacity :) 
feel free to test it out! but it is still far away from finished.
Would be nice, if someone like to join the project or give some feedback. 

**GameConcept:**

travel through space, develop planets--- try to get a huge population in several solar systems

grow food, get water, produce technology, industry

build cities, metrolopes to enhance your population.

**Done so far:**

- building system, building editor, 
- solar system (1) so far.
- ship moving mechanics, ship energy reloading, ship orbiting 
- planet editor, planet orbit around sun
- json database to store all planets, resources and buildings
- collectable items
- panning system
- dynamic UI
- extendable layer system for bliting the images in the right order 

**work in progress:**

- event system: feedbacks from the game for the user about what is happening 
- implementing of ingame "technology" for building space harbor

**TODO:**
- a lot !!!
- panning and zooming
- nice images for buildings, planets ect

**Problems:**

i dont know how to create a runtime for windows ;( ... i tried many times with pyinstaller, but somehow the libraries are not found

error/ warning:
libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile


**technology used:**

python, pygame, pygame_widget, pygame_menu, json
pycharm, GIMP


**to start the game:**

download the whole folder. open terminal. drag "main.py" into terminal, press enter.
--- hopefully the game starts ---
